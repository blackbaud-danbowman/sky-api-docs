Monitor this page to keep up with the [Opportunity API (Beta)]({{ stache.config.portal_endpoints_opportunity }}) latest changes and {{ stache.config.api_type_name }} service releases.

##2017-05-08

### Changed

We updated the [Opportunity (Get)]({{stache.config.portal_endpoints_opportunity_get}}) endpoint to populate the `date_added` and `date_modified` properties.

##2017-04-27

### Changed

We added the `linked_gifts` property to the [opportunity]({{ stache.config.opportunity_entity_reference }}#Opportunity) entity. This property is an array of identifiers for the gifts that are related to the opportunity.

##2017-04-12

### New

The Opportunity API has been released for a public beta. This API handles information related to opportunities, including the opportunity, opportunity attachments, and opportunity fundraiser entities.

The initial release contains endpoints to retrieve these entities by ID and to manage custom fields. For more information, check out the [entity]({{ stache.config.opportunity_entity_reference }}) and [endpoint]({{ stache.config.portal_endpoints_opportunity }}) references.
